# Lab 2: Implementation of Network Topologies

## Objective
To implement and understand different network topologies using Packet Tracer software.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software

## Theory
### Overview of Various Network Topologies
1. **Bus Topology**
   - **Advantages**: Simple to set up, cost-effective for small networks.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited cable length; if the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.

2. **Star Topology**
   - **Advantages**: Easy to install and manage; failure of one device doesnâ€™t affect others.
   - **Disadvantages**: If the central hub fails, the entire network is affected.

3. **Ring Topology**
   - **Advantages**: Predictable performance; easy to add devices.
   - **Disadvantages**: A failure in any cable or device can disrupt the entire network.

4. **Mesh Topology**
   - **Advantages**: High redundancy and reliability.
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex to install and manage; requires a lot of cabling.

5. **Hybrid Topology**
   - **Advantages**: Flexible and scalable.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can be complicated to design and manage.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**.
   
2. **Implement a Bus Topology**:
   - Connected at least three PCs using a coaxial cable.
   - **Ping Test**: All PCs successfully communicated.

3. **Implement a Star Topology**:
   - Used a switch to connect three PCs with straight-through cables.
   - **Ping Test**: All PCs successfully communicated.

4. **Implement a Ring Topology**:
   - Arranged three PCs in a circular pattern and connected them.
   - **Ping Test**: All PCs successfully communicated.

5. **Implement a Mesh Topology**:
   - Connected four PCs to each other.
   - **Ping Test**: All PCs successfully communicated.

## Observations
- **Bus Topology**: All PCs pinged successfully.
- **Star Topology**: All PCs pinged successfully.
- **Ring Topology**: All PCs pinged successfully.
- **Mesh Topology**: All PCs pinged successfully.

## Conclusion
Each topology has distinct characteristics:
- **Bus Topology** is simple but vulnerable to single points of failure.
- **Star Topology** is robust, relying on a central hub.
- **Ring Topology** has predictable performance but is sensitive to disruptions.
- **Mesh Topology** offers redundancy at the cost of complexity.
- **Hybrid Topology** provides flexibility but may complicate design.

Understanding these topologies is essential for designing efficient and reliable networks tailored to specific needs.
